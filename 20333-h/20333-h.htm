<h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

<p class="center">THE KEEPER. (<i>Continued.</i>)</p>

<p>Is there no way, then, you may ask, in which the Head Keeper
may be lured from his customary silence for more than a sentence or
two? Yes, there is one absolutely certain method, and, so far as
I know, only one. The subject to which you must lead your conversation
is&mdash;no, it isn't poachers, for a good keeper takes the occasional
poacher as part of his programme. He wages war against
him, of course; and, if his shooting happens to be situated near a
town of some importance, the war is often a very sanguinary one,
only ended by the extermination (according to Assize-Court methods)
of the poachers. But the keeper, as I say, takes all this as a matter
of course. He recognises that poachers, after all, are men; as a
sportsman, he must have a sneaking sympathy for one whose science
and wood-craft often baffle his own; and, therefore, though he
fights against him sturdily and conscientiously, and, as a rule,
triumphs over him, he does not generally, being what I have described
him, brag of these victories, nor, indeed, does he care to talk
about them. "There, but for the grace of God, goes Velveteens,"
must be the mental exclamation
of many a good keeper when he
hears his enemy sentenced to a
period of compulsory confinement.
I do not wish to be misunderstood.
There are poachers and
poachers. And whereas we may
have a certain sympathy for the
instinct of sport that seems to
compel some men to match their
skill against the craft of fur or
feather reared at the expense and
by the labour of others, there can
surely be none for the methodical
rogues who band themselves together
on business principles, and
plunder coverts just
as others crack cribs,
or pick pockets.
Even sentiment is
wasted on these gentlemen.</p>

<p>But I return from
this digression. The
one subject, then, on
which a keeper may
be trusted to become
eloquent, is, that of</p>

<p><span class="sc">Foxes</span>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/037.png"><img width="100%" src="images/037-alt.png" alt="Taking away his Character." /></a><h3>"Taking away his Character."</h3></div>

<p>Just try him. Suppose
you are shooting
a wood, in which you
expect to find a considerable
number of
pheasants. The guns
are posted, the beaters
have begun to move
at the far end of the
wood. Suddenly you
are aware of a commotion in the middle of the wood. Here and
there pheasants rise long before the beaters have approached.
There is a whirring of wings, and dozens of birds sail away, un-shot
at, to right, to left, and all over the place. And then, while
you are still wondering what this may mean, a fine dog-fox comes
sliding out from the covert. Away he goes at top speed across
the open. The little stops view him as he passes, and far and near
the air resounds with shrill "yoick!" and "tally-ho!" In the end
four birds are brought to bag, where twenty at least had been
expected. When the beat is over, this is the kind of conversation
you will probably hear:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Beater</i> (<i>to a colleague</i>). I seed 'un, <span class="sc">Jim</span>; a great, fine fox 'e
were, a slinkin' off jest afore we coom up. "Go it," I says to
myself; "go it, Muster <span class="sc">Billy Fox</span>, you bin spoilin' sport, I'll
warrant, time you was off"; and out 'e popped as sly as fifty on 'em,
ah, that 'e was.</p>

<p><i>Second B.</i> Ah! I lay 'e was that. Where did 'e slip to, <span class="sc">Tom</span>?</p>

<p><i>First B.</i> I heerd 'em a hollerin' away by <span class="sc">Chuff's</span> Farm. Reckon
'e's goin' to hev 'is supper there, to-night.</p>

<p><i>Second B.</i> And a pretty meal 'e'll make of it. Pheasant for
breakfast, pheasant for dinner, pheasant for tea; I'll lay 'e don't
get much thinner.</p>

<p><i>One of the Guns</i> (<i>to the Keeper</i>). Nuisance about that fox, <span class="sc">Sykes</span>.</p>

<p><i>Keeper.</i> Nuisance, Sir? You may say that. Why, I've seen as
many as four o' them blamed varmints one after another in this 'ere
blessed wood. Did you see 'im, Sir? I wish you'd a shot 'im just
by mistake. Nobody wouldn't a missed 'im. But there, a-course I
daren't touch 'em. Mr. <span class="sc">Chalmers</span> wouldn't like it, and a-course
I couldn't bring myself to do it. But I do say, we've got too many
on 'em, and we never get the hounds, or if they do come, they
can't kill. What am I to do? Mr. <span class="sc">Chalmers</span> wants birds, and 'e
wants foxes too. I tell 'im 'e can't have both. I does my best, but
what's a man to do with a couple o' thousand foxes nippin' the
heads off of his birds? Fairly breaks my heart, Sir. Keep 'em
alive, indeed! Live and let live's my motter, but it ain't the plan
o' them blamed foxes.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>And so forth ad lib.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There are other animals which your true keeper holds in aversion.
And chief amongst these is the domestic cat. You might as well
try to keep a journalist from his writing-paper as country cats from
the coverts. They are inveterate and determined poachers, and,
alas, they meet with scant mercy from the keeper if he catches
them. Many a fireside tabby or tortoise-shell dies a violent death
in the course of every year, and is buried in a secret grave. This
often gives rise to disturbance, for the cottager, to whom the deceased
was as the apple of her eye, may make complaint of the keeper
to his master. My friend <span class="sc">Sykes</span>, one of the best keepers I know,
once related to me an
incident of this nature.
As it may help
to explain the nature
of keepers, and throw
light on the conversational
method to be
adopted with them, I
here set down the
winged words in which
<span class="sc">Sykes</span> addressed me.</p>

<p>"Trouble, Sir? I
believe you. Them
old women gives me a
peck o' trouble, far
more nor the breakin'
of a retriever dog.
There's old Mrs. <span class="sc">Padstow</span>,
Mother <span class="sc">Padds</span>
we call 'er, she's a
rare old teaser. Went
up to Mr. <span class="sc">Chalmers</span>
last week and told 'im
I'd shot 'er pet cat.
Mr. <span class="sc">Chalmers</span>, 'e
spoke to me about it;
said I'd better go and
make it right with the
old gal. So, yesterday
I goes to call upon 'er.
First we passed the
time o' day together,
and then we got to
business. You see,
Sir, me and the old
lady had always been
friendly, so I took it
on the friendly line.
'Look 'ere,' I says,
'Mrs. <span class="sc">Padstow</span>, I've
come about a cat.' 'Ah,' she says. 'It's just this way,' I says,
'Mr. <span class="sc">Chalmers</span> tells me you said I'd shot your cat. Now,' I says,
straightenin' myself up and lookin' proud, 'I couldn't scarcely believe
that, and you and me such good friends, so I've just come to ask you
if you did say that. She was a bit took aback at this, so I asked 'er
again. 'Well,' she says, 'I didn't exactly say that.' 'What did you
say then?' I asked her. 'I told Mr. <span class="sc">Chalmers</span>,' she says, 'that our
old cat 'ad been shot what never did no 'arm, and I thought it might
be as you'd a done it, p'raps not meanin' it.' 'Ah,' I says, 'them
was your words, was they?' 'Yes,' she says, 'them was my words.'
'Well, then,' I says, 'you'd better be careful what you say next time,
or you don't know whose character you'll be takin' away next.' And
with that I left 'er."</p>

<p>"But did you shoot the cat, <span class="sc">Sykes</span>?" I ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> I shoot it? Ho, ho, ha, ha! What do <i>you</i> think! Sir?"</p>

<p>And with that enigmatic answer the dialogue closed.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">When</span> referring to a recent Lecture by a certain Noble Marquis
(distinguished in the "<i>P.R.</i>-age" of the Realm), the ladies generally
say, that they should decidedly object to be married "under the
Queensberry Rules." <i>Their</i> prize ring is quite another affair.</p>

<h2>THE DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTR&Ouml;M.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/038.png"><img width="100%" src="images/038-alt.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Fragments from a Narrative somewhat in the style of E. A. Poe.</i>)</p>

<p>Even while one gazed, the current acquired a monstrous velocity.</p>

<p>Each moment added to its speed&mdash;to its headlong impetuosity.</p>

<p>The vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand
conflicting channels, burst suddenly into frenzied convulsion&mdash;heaving,
boiling, hissing,&mdash;gryrating in gigantic and innumerable
vortices, and all whirling and plunging on with a rapidity which
water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents.</p>

<hr />

<p>Precipitous descents! Niagara's abrupt and headlong plunge is but
as an eddy in a rocky trout-stream compared with what was soon to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>
seen <i>here</i>. In brief
space there came over
the scene another
radical alteration. The
general surface grew
somewhat more
smooth, and the whirlpools
one by one disappeared,
while prodigious
streaks of
foam became apparent
where none had been
seen before. These
streaks, at length,
spreading out to a
great distance, and
entering into combination,
took unto
themselves the gyratory
motion of the
subsided vortices, and
seemed to form the
germ of another more
vast. Suddenly&mdash;very
suddenly&mdash;this assumed
a distinct and
definite existence in a
circle of a colossal and
seemingly all-embracing
diameter. The
edge of the whirl was
represented by a broad
belt of gleaming,
turbid slime&mdash;cumbered
spray, foul,
festering, furiously
troubled, slipping, as
it seemed, particle by
particle, viscid gout
by gout, into the
mouth of the terrific
funnel, whose interior,
as far as the eye could
fathom it, was a
smooth, shining, and
jet-black wall of
water, inclined to the
horizon at an angle of
some forty-five degrees,
speeding dizzily
round and round, with
a swaying and sweltering
motion, and
sending forth to the
winds an appalling
voice half shriek, half
roar, such as not
even the mighty
cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.</p>

<hr />

<p>Then, said I, this <i>can</i> be nothing else than the "great, all-whelming
whirlpool of the Maelstr&ouml;m!"</p>

<hr />

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/039.png"><img width="100%" src="images/039-alt.png" alt="FASHIONABLE." /></a><h3>FASHIONABLE.</h3>

<p>"<span class="sc">How do you like me in this, Vera? Tell me the Truth</span>."</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Well, dear, it looks as if your pet Poodle had Died, and you'd had him
made up as a Cloak</span>!"</p></div>

<p>In all violent eddies at sea <i>there is good fishing</i>, at proper opportunities,
if only one has the courage to attempt it. In fact, it is made
a matter of desperate speculation&mdash;risk standing instead of labour,
and courage, of a reckless, and not too scrupulous sort, answering
for capital. But there are many who would lightly adventure the
pestilential perils of a tropic stream, or fever-haunted water-way or
canal, who would yet shrink from being caught&mdash;owing to want of
care, and cautious calculation as to the exact hours of slack and
safety&mdash;by the hideous, irresistible, all-engulfing, all-wrecking
whirl of the terrifying Str&ouml;m! Once drawn within the down-draught
of that hideous vortex, a whole army might be destroyed
more certainly than even by the manifold death-dealing contrivances
of modern science, a whole legislature lost in a single hour of
ghastly and unhonoured catastrophe!</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh, the sickening sweep of that descent! With what sensations of
awe, horror, and strange, distraught admiration, must a doomed
victim, once within that whirl, gaze about him!&mdash;for he has leisure
to observe. The downward draught of those swift, wide-sweeping,
spirally-whirling water-walls is comparatively slow. The victim
clinging to his boat, or bound to his spar or barrel, appears to be
hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface
of a funnel, vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and
whose perfectly
smooth sides might be
mistaken for ebony,
but for the bewildering
rapidity with
which they spin
around, and for the
gleaming and ghastly
radiance they shoot
forth, a foul, phosphorescent
iridescence, as
of accumulated corruption,
streaming in
a flood of loathsome
radiance along the
black walls, and far
away down into the
inmost mist&mdash;veiled
recesses of the abyss!</p>

<hr />

<p>Looking about upon
the wide waste of
liquid ebony on which
that helpless, past-struggling,
beautiful,
and apparently doomed
figure was borne, I
perceived that she, in
the midst of the
mighty, all-mastering
misery, was not the
only object in the
embrace of the whirl.
Both above and below
were visible fragments
of wreckage&mdash;significant
wreckage&mdash;plumed
hats, sword-sheaths,
portfolios,
epaulettes, decorations,
insignia of
honour, as if here a
national Argosy, laden
with Opulence, Rank
Intelligence, and
Honour, had gone,
dismally and desperately,
down to&mdash;<i>what</i>?
Let those
Phlegethon walls,
that Tophet-like
mist, make answer!</p>

<hr />

<p>And that bound,
helpless, seemingly
doomed, but beautiful
and piteously appealing
figure on
which my eyes were fixed in terror, and amaze, and profound compassion?
Alas! Yet are there some objects which enter the whirl
at a late period of the tide, which for some happy reason descend
slowly after entering, which do not reach the bottom before the turn
of the tide, which are <i>not completely absorbed</i> ere the desperate
ordeal of danger is ended by utter submergence and entire wreck!
These, conceivably, may be whirled up again to the level of the ocean,
without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more
early, or absorbed more rapidly!</p>

<hr />

<p>Here indeed the phantom of Hope seems to gleam forth rainbow-like
even amidst the foul mists of the Maelstr&ouml;m! That beautiful
agonised figure seems yet but as it were at the edge of the whirl. Into
its profound and pestilential depths, indeed, she <i>can see</i>. And she
shudders at the sight, as must all who are interested in her fate.
But the Str&ouml;m will not whirl for ever, the hour of slack cannot be
far off, and when the slope of the sides of the vast funnel become
momentarily less and less steep, when the gyrations of the whirl grow
gradually less and less violent, when the froth and the fume disappear,
and the bottom of the gulf seems slowly to uprise; when the sky
clears, and the winds go down, and the full moon rises radiantly
o'er the swaying but no longer tormented floods, shall she, that
beautiful, bound creature be found floating upon the quieting waves,
sorely buffeted, may be much scarred, bearing in her beauty ineffaceable
traces of the hideous ordeal she has undergone, but living,
and <i>Safe</i>?</p>

<hr />

<p>So may it be!</p>

<h2>CHARLEY'S OLD 'AUNT AT THE ROYALTY.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/040a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/040a-alt.png" alt="Like as Two P's!" /></a><h3><span class="sc">Like as Two P's</span>!</h3>

<p><i>The Private Secretary.</i> "Excuse me, Madam? but, d'you know, I fancy
you must be a connection of mine&mdash;I see such a resemblance to our family.
I am the Rev. Robert Spalding!"</p>

<p><i>Lord Fancourt Babberley.</i> "Oh yes; and I'm Charley's Aunt, and Robert's
Cousin."</p>

<p><i>The P. S.</i> "Dear me! Fancy that!"</p></div>

<p><i>Charley's Aunt</i>, by Mr. <span class="sc">Brandon Thomas</span>, is distinctly related
to <i>The Private Secretary</i>; and Mr. <span class="sc">Penley</span>, as <i>Lord Babberley</i>,
is second cousin to the <i>Rev. Mr. Spalding</i>, who, as the Private
Secretary, obtained so distinguished a position in the theatrical
world not so many years ago. As a play, <i>The Private Secretary</i>
had a strange history, seeing that it began as a failure, had an
Act cut out of it, and, surviving this severe operation, grew into
an enormous success, then went "so strong" as to be able to keep
on running in London, the Provinces, our Colonies, and America,
for some years.</p>

<p><i>Charley's Aunt</i>, however, has experienced no such downs and
ups, being born to the rouge-pot as heiress of the great success which
<i>The Private Secretary</i> had only gradually, though surely, achieved.
Yet 'tis a matter for question whether the latter was not the better
piece, dramatically, of the two, having, besides its own comic situations,
two irresistibly diverting characters, represented by little
<span class="sc">Penley</span> and mountainous <span class="sc">Hill</span>, both playing into one another's hands.</p>

<p>There are very few comparatively dull moments in <i>Charley's Aunt</i>,
and these arise from faulty construction necessitating occasional
explanations which come as dampers in the midst of the uproarious
fun whereat the house has been shaking its sides and even weeping
with laughter. And the awkwardness of these pauses in the
action is still further emphasised by their being filled up with either
commonplace narrative, or with a kind of cheap sentimentality quite
at variance with the general tone of the piece. Were this slight
blemish removed, the longevity of <i>Charley's Aunt</i> would, it is
more than probable, equal that of <i>The Private Secretary</i>.</p>

<p>All the parts are well played. Mr. <span class="sc">Brandon Thomas</span> has not
given himself much of a chance as <i>Colonel Chesney</i>, who bears a
strong family resemblance to the heavy dragoon in the <i>Pantomime
Rehearsal</i>. The young men, Messrs. <span class="sc">Percy Lyndal</span> and <span class="sc">Farmer</span>,
have plenty of "go"&mdash;it would be "little go" were they Cantabs&mdash;as
the two undergraduates, young enough to be still up at College
completing their education, yet old enough to propose and be accepted
as eligible husbands. But in a rattling three-act farce as this is
intended to be, any exaggeration is sufficiently probable as long only
as it is thoroughly amusing; and, it be added, in such a piece,
sentiment is as much out of place as would be plain matter-of-fact
conduct or dialogue. To see Mr. <span class="sc">Penley</span> in the elderly Aunt's
dress is to convulse the house without his uttering a word.
To see him enjoying himself with the young ladies while threatened
by their lovers, who cannot take them away without compromising
themselves, is delicious. Then, when after dinner he is alone with
the ladies, and having been informed by the scout&mdash;capitally impersonated
by Mr. <span class="sc">Cecil Thornbury</span>&mdash;in a whisper, what story it is
that the gentlemen find so amusing, he goes into fits of laughter, and
subsequently, when after one of the ladies has told a story which makes
the girls laugh, he inquires "Is that all?" and being answered that
it is, he cannot refrain from expressing, in very strong language, his
opinion of the stupidity of the anecdote he has just heard, and then is
seized with a perfect convulsion of laughter,&mdash;in all this he is most
heartily joined by the entire audience, who laugh with him and at
him. Altogether in this piece Mr. <span class="sc">Penley</span> is inimitably and irresistibly
funny.</p>

<p>The piece has one other merit which is not the least among its
attractions, that is, that it begins at nine punctually and is over
by eleven, thus yielding two hours of all-but continuous merriment.</p>

<hr />

<h2>SIMPLE STORIES.</h2>

<p class="center">"Be always kind to animals wherever you may be!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:33%;"><a href="images/040b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/040b-alt.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><span class="sc">Elsie</span> was growing a big girl, and though she was still in short
frocks, she gave herself airs, and had ideas about dress, and sometimes
was tempted to argue with her dear Mamma and give her a pert
answer. She was, however in high glee just now, because she had
been invited by her Aunt <span class="sc">Dabblechick</span> to a pic-nic with a lot of other
little boys and girls. She made a great fuss about her dress, she
studied <i>The Queen</i>, and <i>The Gentlewoman</i>, and other papers devoted
to this important subject, and
worried her poor Mamma with
all sorts of silly suggestions.
The costume, however, was at
last arranged, and the little
goose was cross because her
Mamma would not allow her to
have a blue feather in her hat.
<span class="sc">Elsie</span>, like a naughty child,
determined that she would,
by some means or other, have
this feather.</p>

<p>How to obtain one was the
difficulty. At last it struck
her that the splendid Macaw,
a gift from her Uncle, Admiral
<span class="sc">Sangarorum</span>, brought from Brazil,
had some lovely feathers of
about the right tint.</p>

<p>Taking a few lumps of sugar
with her, she paid a visit to the
conservatory where "Lord Macawley,"
as he was called, swung
all day and shrieked. She felt
how naughty she was, but her
overweening vanity quite stifled
her conscience. She scratched
the bird's poll, treated him to
several lumps of sugar, and, when he was not looking, suddenly
jerked one of the finest feathers out of his tail.</p>

<p>"Lord Macawley" screamed furiously, and <span class="sc">Elsie</span> was terribly
frightened for fear she should be discovered. She, however, ran
away with her prize, and carefully fixed it in her hat.</p>

<p>The next morning when she was ready to start, and <span class="sc">James</span> was
waiting with the pony-chaise to drive her over to her Aunt's, her
Mamma, who was gathering flowers in the conservatory, sent for
her to see that she looked nice before starting. Very pretty the
little girl looked in her peacock blue dress, her snowy frills, her
black-silk stockings, and Oxford shoes.</p>

<p>Her hat was trimmed with ribbon to match her dress, and her
feather so artfully intertwined, that she hoped her Mamma would
not notice it. It certainly would have passed without observation,
but, just as <span class="sc">Elsie</span> was tripping away, "Lord Macawley"
saw her.</p>

<p>He set up a fiendish scream, and then said, "G-r-r! Gr-r-r!
Who stole my feather?" over and over again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Elsie</span> turned scarlet. Mamma removed and inspected the hat,
and, the little girl was promptly packed off to bed, where she was
left to shed many tears over her folly for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Mamma keeps the blue feather, which she shows to her little
girl whenever she is inclined to be disobedient or vain. The
exhibition usually has a magical effect.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Interior of the Sanctum of
the</i> Young <span class="sc">Khedive</span>. <i>Present,
his Highness. To him enter the</i>
British Representative.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> I think your Highness
desired to see me?</p>

<p><i>Khedive.</i> Certainly, my dear Lord.
I wish to express once again my great
regret that I could have done, or
said, or thought anything without
taking your advice. You have quite
forgiven me?</p>

<p><i>Brit. Rep.</i> (<i>in a tone of respectful
annoyance</i>). Thank you very much,
your Highness; but as I am exceptionally
busy this morning, I think,
if you have nothing more to say to
me, I will do myself the honour of
taking my departure.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> Oh no&mdash;a thousand times,
no! Are you not aware that I am
very European in tastes, am fond of
books, and have a hobby in a small
aquarium?</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> So I have read, your
Highness, in a London evening
paper. And now, if you will permit
me, I will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> Oh no&mdash;don't go, I promised
you I would consult you in every
important matter&mdash;and I mean to
keep my word.</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> I am glad to hear your
Highness say so; and I can answer
for Her Majesty's Government being
extremely gratified at the report of
this conversation. I shall make a
point of communicating with the
Premier forthwith. And now, with
your Highness's gracious permission,
I will take my leave.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> What a hurry you are in! I have got a lot of important
things to consult you about, and yet you won't wait a moment! I
say, it's not treating a fellow fairly!</p>

<p><i>Brit. Rep.</i> (<i>grieved</i>). I trust your Highness will not repeat that
observation after due consideration. But to show you my anxiety
to meet your Highness's wishes, I will sacrifice the examination of a
promising scheme to make the Nile nine and a half times as productive
as it is now, to listen to you.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> You are very good. Well, what do you think of my
dressing-gown?</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> Capital&mdash;in every way capital. But surely you didn't
want to talk about that?</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> Oh, yes, I did! Would you advise me to have it trimmed
with any more fur?</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> I should imagine it was more a matter of taste than
politics.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> Oh, hang politics! What do you think about my dressing-gown?
Would your Government recommend fur?</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> I think, under the circumstances, I can act on my own
responsibility without further reference to Her Majesty's Government.
Yes, by all means, have fur.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> I am infinitely obliged to you. Fact is, I told my tailor
I thought I would have fur, but I did not like to give the order
without your advice.</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> I trust your Highness accepts my assurance that
Her Majesty's Government are most anxious to prevent you from
appearing in a false position.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> It's most civil of you to say so. Then I will have fur.</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> And now, if your Highness no longer requires my
presence&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). But I do. As I have already said, I've a lot
of things to ask you. Now, I want to know whether it would be to
the benefit of the fellaheen if I visited the theatre more frequently?</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> Your Highness will use your own discretion. I think
I may say, without further reference to Downing Street, that Her
Majesty's Government will have not the slightest objection to your
Highness indulging in any innocent recreation.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> Come&mdash;that's very good of them. But don't go. Look
here. There will be no great harm if I wear brown leather boots?</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> I think not, if your Highness, by the exhibition of
such a preference, does not wound the susceptibilities of other
Powers. And now, your Highness, with your permission, I think I
must withdraw.</p>

<p><i>Khe.</i> Very well. If you won't stay any longer I suppose you
won't. If I want any more advice I will send over to you.</p>

<p><i>British Rep.</i> I am extremely obliged to your Highness.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Bows, and exit.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Khe.</i> Glad he's gone! And now that I have consulted him about
everything, I think I will have a little recreation on my own
account. What shall I do? Oh, I know, I will dismiss the entire
Ministry!</p>

<p><i>"Eton of Old, or,

exclaimed the Baron, and,
taking up the handsome
volume recently published
by Messrs. <span class="sc">Griffith and
Farran</span>, he was soon absorbed
in its pages.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Rather disappointing,"
murmured the Baron, as
he closed the book, and
"read no more that day."
"Why, with a good memory,
a lively imagination,
and a pleasant style,
this 'Old Colleger' might
have given us something
far more amusing than he
has done. Of course Anybody's
Anecdotes of our
Grand Old School will probably
be interesting up to
a certain point: and they
might be made 'funny,
without being vulgar.'
But this worthy Octogenarian,
be he who he may,
has produced only a very
matter-of-fact book, containing
historic information
likely to arrest the
attention of an old or
young Etonian, but only
now and again does the
author give us anything
sufficiently amusing to
evoke a laugh. However,
in the course of perusal,
I have smiled gently, but
distinctly. Had the Octogenarian
already told
many of these stories to
his intimates, to whom
their narration caused as
much facile entertainment
as was given to the friends
of <i>Mr. Peter Magnus</i>,
when he signed himself
'<span class="sc">Afternoon</span>,' in substitution
for his initials,
'P.M.'?" And it is related
how <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> rather
envied the ease with which <i>Mr. Magnus's</i> friends were entertained.
If so, then is the Baron to the Octogenarian Etonian and his intimates
as was <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> to "P. M." and his correspondents. There
are some good tales about <span class="sc">Keat</span> and <span class="sc">Hawtrey</span>, and of course the
book, as one among an Etonian series, has its own value for all who
care about Eton of the past.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>Perdidi diem</i>," says the Baron, "or at least the better part of
it, in reading <i>Zero the Slaver</i>, by <span class="sc">Lawrence Fletcher</span>, who seems
to me to be a promising pupil in the school of <span class="sc">Rider Haggard</span> and
<span class="sc">Louis Stevenson</span>, but chiefly of the former. It was a beastly day,
snow falling, and North-West-by-North wind howling, bitterly
cold, and so," continued the Baron, "I was reduced to <i>Zero</i>. The
construction of the plot is clever, as is also the description of a great
fight, in the latter portion of the story; but, as a whole, the story
is irritatingly ill-written, and tawdrily coloured, while italics are
used to bring into prominence any description of some strongly sensational
situation."</p>

<p>Few things so annoying to me, personally, as the romancer speaking
of his chief puppets as "our friends." This <span class="sc">Lawrence
Fletcher</span> is perpetually doing. Now his heroes are not "my
friends," for, when I read, I am strictly impartial, at all events,
through two-thirds of the book, and, if I learn to love any one or
two (or more) of them, male or female, I should still resent the
author's presuming to speak of them as "our friends." To do so
from the first is simply impudent presumption on the part of the
author, as why, on earth, should he assume that his creations&mdash;his
children&mdash;should be as dear to us as they are to him?</p>

<p>No&mdash;"Our friends," so used, is a mistake.</p>

<p>The influence of <span class="sc">Rider Haggard</span> is over the whole book, but in
two instances the author has been unable to resist close imitation,
nay, almost quotation of a
well-known Haggardism,
and so he writes at
p. 130:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Just then a very wonderful
and awful thing happened."</p></blockquote>

<p>And at p. 197:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"When suddenly, and without
an instant's warning, a
most awful thing happened."</p></blockquote>

<p>Both variations on a Haggardism,
and both equally
spoilt in the process of
transferring and adapting.</p>

<p>One sentence, the utterance
of a Zulu chief, is
well worth quoting, and it
is this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"But empty hands are evil
things wherewith to face a
well-armed spook."</p></blockquote>

<p>"The well-armed spook"
is a joy for ever.</p>

<p><i>"A great black man
fleeted past the rocks."</i>
"Hum!" quoth the Baron,
"fleeted" is a new word
to me. Not that I object
to its invention and use on
that account; in sound
and appearance it expresses
no more than "sped," or,
if pursuit is to be implied,
"fled."</p>

<p>Here is something that
this novelist having written
may well lay to heart,</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"The man was as white-skinned
as themselves, and
judging from the purity of his
English, must have been at one
time a British subject."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>"Now," quoth the
Baron, meditatively, "if
purity of English, with or
without a white skin, is
the unmistakable mark of
a 'British subject,' then it
follows that Mr. <span class="sc">Lawrence
Fletcher</span> is of some
nationality other than
British. At least, such is
the logical conclusion arrived at by his humble but critical servant,</p>

his she didn't trust for a minute, and had implored her to do likewise,
she only murmured to herself, "<i>Had I a heart for falsehood
framed</i>&mdash;&mdash;" Whereupon he vowed that such a thing was impossible;
but, supposing her to possess such a heart, what would she
do with it, considering it as a frame? Then she replied, softly,
"I should put your portrait in it."</p>

under-tone.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> It's all right, <span class="sc">Seakale</span>
got in at <span class="sc">Blankley</span>'s just as
they were closing. They said they
would send round and stop the person,
if possible&mdash;but they couldn't
say, for certain, whether
he mightn't have started
already.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> Then he may
come, even now! May I
ask what you intend to do
if he does, <span class="sc">Montague</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> Well, that's
what I rather wanted to ask
<i>you</i>, my dear. We might tell
<span class="sc">Seakale</span> to send him away.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> If you do, he'll
be certain to send away the
wrong person&mdash;Uncle <span class="sc">Gabriel</span>,
as likely as not!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> Um&mdash;&mdash;yes, I
never thought of that&mdash;no,
he must be shown up.
Couldn't you explain to him,
quietly, that we have made
up our party and shan't require
his&mdash;hem&mdash;services?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> I? Certainly
<i>not</i>, <span class="sc">Montague</span>. <i>You</i> hired
him, and you must get rid
of him yourself!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>uneasily.</i>) 'Pon
my word, <span class="sc">Maria</span>, it's an
awkward thing to do. I
almost think we'd better
keep him if he comes&mdash;we
shall have to <i>pay</i> for him
anyhow. After all, he'll be
quite inoffensive&mdash;nobody
will notice he's been hired
for the evening.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> He may be one
of the assistants out of the
shop for all we can tell. And
you're going to let him stay
and make us thirteen, the
identical thing he was hired
to avoid! Well, I shall
have to let Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> dine, after all&mdash;that's what it comes to, and
this creature can take her down&mdash;it will be a little change for her.
<span class="sc">Gwennie</span>, my pet, run down and tell <span class="sc">Seakale</span> that if he hears me
ring twice after everybody has come, he's to lay two extra places
before he announces dinner. (<span class="sc">Gwennie</span> <i>departs reluctantly</i>; Mrs. T.
<i>crosses to</i> Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>.) Oh, Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>, my husband and I have
been thinking whether we couldn't manage to find a place for you at
dinner to-night. Of course, it is <i>most</i> unusual, and you must not
expect us to make a <i>precedent</i> of it; but&mdash;er&mdash;you seem rather out
of spirits, and perhaps a little cheerful society&mdash;just for once&mdash;&mdash;I
don't know if it can be arranged yet, but I will let you know about
that later on.</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I do believe she <i>means</i> to be kind!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Of course, I shall be very pleased to dine, if you wish it.</p>

<p><i>Seakale</i> (<i>at door</i>). Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Gabriel Gilwattle</span>, and
Miss <span class="sc">Bugle</span>!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Enter a portly old Gentleman, with light prominent eyes and a
crest of grizzled auburn hair, in the wake of an imposing
Matron in ruby velvet: they are followed by an elderly
Spinster in black and silver, who rattles with jet.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Bugle</i> (<i>after the usual greetings</i>).
I hope, dearest <span class="sc">Maria</span>, you will excuse
me if I am not quite in my usual spirits
this evening; but my cockatoo, whom I
have had for ages, has been in convulsions
the whole afternoon, and though I
left him calmer, done up in warm flannel
on the rug in front of the fire, and the
maid promised faithfully to sit up with
him, and telegraph if there was the
slightest change, I can't help feeling I
ought never to have come.</p>

<p><i>Aunt Joanna</i> (<i>to her host.</i>) Such a drive
as it is here, all the way from Regent's
Park, and in this fog&mdash;I told
<span class="sc">Gabriel</span> that if he escapes
bronchitis to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Seakale.</i> Mr. and Mrs.
<span class="sc">Ditchwater</span>! Mr. <span class="sc">Toomer</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ditch.</i> Yes, dear Mrs.
<span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span>, our opportunities
for these festive meetings
grow more and more limited
with each advancing year.
Seven dear friends, at whose
board we have sat, and they
at ours, within the past
twelve months, carried off&mdash;all
gone from us!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ditch.</i> <i>Eight</i>, <span class="sc">Jeremiah</span>,
if you count Mr.
<span class="sc">Jaunders</span>&mdash;though <i>he</i> only
dined with us once.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ditch.</i> To be sure,
and never left his bed again.
Well, well, it should teach
us, as I was remarking to
my dear wife as we drove
along, to set a higher value
than we do on such hospitalities
as we are still privileged
to enjoy.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toomer</i> (<i>to</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Tid.</span>)
My poor wife would, I am
sure, have charged me with
all manner of messages, if
she had not been more or
less delirious all day&mdash;but I
am in no anxiety about her&mdash;she
is so often like that, it
is almost chronic.</p>

<p><i>Seakale.</i> Mr. and Mrs.
<span class="sc">Bodfish</span>! Miss <span class="sc">Flinders</span>!
Mr. <span class="sc">Poffley</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bodf.</i> (<i>after salutations.</i>)
Mrs. <span class="sc">Bodfish</span> and
myself have just been the
victims of a most extraordinary
mistake! We positively
walked straight into
your next-door neighbour's
house, and if we had not
been undeceived by a mummy
on the first landing, I don't
know where we should have
found ourselves next.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> <i>A mummy!</i> How <i>very</i> disagreeable; such a <i>peculiar</i>
thing to have about a house? But we really know nothing about the
people next door. We have never encouraged any intimacy. We
thought it best.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bodf.</i> I told their man-servant as we came away that I considered
he had behaved disgracefully in not telling us our mistake
at once; no doubt he had a motive; people <i>are</i> so unprincipled!</p>

<p><i>Little Gwendolen</i> (<i>drawing</i> Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> <i>into a corner</i>). Oh, Miss
<span class="sc">Seaton</span>, what <i>do</i> you think? Mother's going to let you dine downstairs
with them&mdash;won't <i>that</i> be nice for you? At least, she's going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
to, if somebody comes, and you're to go down with him. He isn't like
a <i>regular</i> dinner-guest, you know. Papa hired him from <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>
this morning, and Mother and he both hope he mayn't come, after
all; but <i>I</i> hope he <i>will</i>, because I want to see what he's like. Don't
<i>you</i> hope he'll come? <i>Don't</i> you, Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>, dear?</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Then <i>that</i> was why! And I can't even
refuse! (<i>Aloud.</i>) My dear <span class="sc">Gwennie</span>, you shouldn't tell me all
these things&mdash;they're secrets, and I'm sure your Mother would be
very angry indeed if she heard you mention them to <i>anybody</i>!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> Oh, it was only to you, Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>, and you're <i>nobody</i>,
you know! And I <i>can</i> keep a secret, if I choose. I never told how
<span class="sc">Jane</span> used to&mdash;&mdash;[Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> <i>endeavours to check these disclosures</i>.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>out of temper, on the hearth-rug</i>). Seven minutes
past the hour, <span class="sc">Monty</span>&mdash;and, if there's a thing I'm particular about,
it's not being kept waiting for my dinner. Are you expecting
somebody else? or what <i>is</i> it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>nervously</i>). Well, I half thought&mdash;but we won't wait
any longer for him&mdash;he is not worth it&mdash;ha! there he is&mdash;I think
I heard the front door&mdash;so perhaps I may as well give him&mdash;&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Just as you like&mdash;<i>my</i> dinner's spoilt as it is. (<i>Catching
sight of the banner-screen.</i>) What have you stuck this precious
affair up for, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> To&mdash;to keep the fire off. <span class="sc">Maria's</span> idea. Uncle&mdash;she
thought our&mdash;hem&mdash;crest and motto would look rather well made up
like this.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>with a snort</i>). Made up! I should think it was!
Though what you want to make yourself out one of those good-for-nothing
aristocrats for is beyond me. You know <i>my</i> sentiments
about 'em&mdash;I'm a thorough-going Radical, and the very sound of a
title&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Seakale</i> (<i>with a fine combination of awe and incredulity</i>). Lord
<span class="sc">Strathsporran</span>!</p>

and rather plain young man enters with an apologetic and even
diffident air, and pauses in evident uncertainty as to his host and
hostess.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>to himself.</i>) A Lord! Bless my soul! <span class="sc">Monty</span> and
<span class="sc">Maria</span> are getting up in the world!</p>

<p><i>Guests</i> (<i>to themselves.</i>) A Lord! No <i>wonder</i> they kept the dinner
back!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>after a hurried glance&mdash;to herself.</i>) Good Heavens!
<span class="sc">Douglas Claymore</span>!&mdash;reduced to this!      [<i>She lowers her head.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>to himself.</i>) They might have told me they were going
to send us a Lord&mdash;<i>I</i> never ordered one! I wonder if he's genuine&mdash;he
don't <i>look</i> it. If I could only find out, quietly!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>to herself.</i>) Gracious! And I was going to send him in
with the Governess! (<i>To her Husb. in a whisper.</i>) <span class="sc">Montague</span>, what
are you <i>about</i>? Go and be civil to him&mdash;do!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Her Way of Putting It.</span>&mdash;Mrs. R. thinks she has an excellent
memory for riddles. She was delighted with that somewhat old
conundrum about "What is more wonderful than <span class="sc">Jonah</span> in the
whale?" to which the answer is, "Two men in a fly," and determined
to puzzle her nephew with it the very next time she met him.
"Such a capital riddle I've got for you, <span class="sc">John</span>!" she exclaimed,
"Let me see. Oh, yes&mdash;I remember&mdash;yes, that's it;" and then,
having settled the form of the question, she put it thus&mdash;"What is
more wonderful than two men in an omnibus?" And when she
gave the answer, "<span class="sc">Jonah</span> in a fly," and correcting herself immediately,
said, "No&mdash;I mean, '<span class="sc">Jonah</span> in a whale,'" her nephew
affectionately recommended his excellent relative to lie down and
take a little rest.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Railway Rates.</span>&mdash;What better rate can there be than that of the
Flying Dutchman to the South, and the Flying Scotchman to the
North; the two hours and a-half express to Bournemouth, and the
Granville two hours to Ramsgate? The word "Rates" is objectionable
as being associated with taxes&mdash;and to avoid the taxes the
Fishermen are going to employ smacks and boys. Poor boys! there
are a lot of smacks about. As the Pantomime and Music-hall poet
sang, "Tooral looral lido, whacky smacky smack!" But though they,
the Fishermen, hereby avoid the Rails, yet they can't do without
their network of lines.</p>

<p>When an actor has to make love to an actress on the stage, it is
"purely a matter of business." Real "love-making" is never a
matter of business; most often 'tis very much the contrary. The
"matter of business" comes in with "making an uncommonly good
marriage," but the love-making has little to do with this, except as
it is, on the stage, "a matter of business."</p>

<h2>THE RAILWAY SERVANT'S VADE-MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> What are the duties of a Pointsman?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> To remember the effect of moving the switches.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When is he likely to cease to remember this important detail?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> After he has been on duty a certain or uncertain number of
hours.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do these conditions also appertain to the labours of a man in
the signal-box?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly, but in a more marked degree.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/048.png"><img width="100%" src="images/048-alt.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><i>Q.</i> What would a collision consequent upon the occasion to which
you have referred be called?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Generally, "an accident."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But would there ever be an exception to this nomenclature?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; in the case of a Coroner being over-officious, and his Jury
"turning nasty."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What would be the effect of this unpleasant combination of
circumstances?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That a verdict of "Manslaughter" would be given against the
occupant of the signal-box.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What would happen to his superiors?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Nothing. However, they would be required to see the proper
evidence was forthcoming at the prisoner's trial.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What would be the end of the incident?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Six months hard labour from the Bench, and a day's sympathy
from the general Public for the ex-occupant of the signal-box.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are the duties of a Station-master?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To be civil to season-ticket holders, and to refer the general
Public to officials of smaller importance than himself.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is your impression of an ideal Station-master?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A gentleman in correct morning dress taking a deep interest
savouring of sincere satisfaction in all the arrangements of the traffic
over which he exercises a qualified control.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If he is asked why such and such a train is an hour late, what
should he reply?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He should observe cheerily that it keeps better time than it
used to do.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Should he ever exhibit surprise?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Only when a train enters the station punctually to the moment,
then he may safely presume that there must have been an accident
somewhere.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And now in conclusion, how can an official secure in all human
probability a long life?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> By taking care never to travel on his own line?</p>
